1. Want to give your overview of project

Jam Buddies is an android application that lets users(musicians) connect and interact to facilate musical interactions.
A user creates a profile and gets authenticated through their email address. While creating a profile a user fills out a series of text fields (name,age, county , town/area ,Bio , instruments , experience , style, links to examples). 
Once a user has done this they can then search for other users profiles and message them . users can see message chats with everyone they interacted with in a similer way to whatsapp. 




2. Document your design design here (why you chose one db over the other)

Sqlite vs JSON based firebase . 


3. Usage guide to setup locally

Download the repositary to your computer . open using android studio . 

to save time you can run the application on an android device instead of build an AVD. Device must be lollipop (5.1) or higher . 
On your android device go into setting -> about device -> build number . tap build number 
7 times  and a message should appear saying developer mode is enabled . After this go back to the settings menu 
enter developer option towards the bottom of the menu . Press enable developer mode  then press enable usb debugging.
connect your device via usb to your machine and android studio should pick it up when you try to run the application

After opening the login app in android studio ensure the click down menu under build on the second line is set to app . Its located between a green play button  and a green hammer .   click on the play button . select your android device and wait for it to build .
